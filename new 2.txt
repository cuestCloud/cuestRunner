Torch - IBM MQ Server Side, current preference for server side is EDA for integrations that are between applications.

-	We’ll request estimates for Oracle and Postgres options
-	The CF -> React/Angular is a re-write. Why not Lucee?

-	Service page says “Refactor / Replace IBM MQ with ActiveMQ”.  Current recommendation is to use EDA.
-	Batch Processing, why “Replace Connect:Direct with Data Router”?   Current recommendation is SFTP (or C : D + if with <F)?
- One interface is listed as IIOP.  Recommendation is re-configure or re-factor to use a web service layer. 
   In most cases it’s just a config setting and re-compile (on both sides) if EJB3 is in use.  
   If that’s the CORBA use, it is minor as only 1 application is listed,
-	IBM DB2 is listed as a database, most likely the default config database being used for Websphere.  The mapping shows it moving to Azure SQL Server (PaaS).  Given the heavy use of MySQL in the application, why not maintain use of a single SQL database technology and migrate the limited DB/2 use to MySQL as well?

TINY user base, 10 users?  Note MOTS says 10,000 users – that’s quite a difference!  
Might not make much sense to keep an app that went from 10,000 to 10 users, if this is really the case.
